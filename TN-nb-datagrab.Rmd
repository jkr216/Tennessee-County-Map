library(sp)
library(readxl)

counties <- readOGR(".", "cb_2015_us_county_20m", verbose = FALSE)

TN <- subset(counties, counties$STATEFP %in% c("47"))

TN <- TN[order(TN$NAME),]

tn_pop_county <- read_excel("~/Tennessee-County-Map/PEP_2015_PEPANNRES.xls", 
    skip = 3)
tn_pop_county<-tn_pop_county[c(-96:-102),c(-2:-4)]
tn_pop_county[,c(2:7)] <- apply(tn_pop_county[,c(2:7)], 2, function(x) gsub(",","", x))
tn_pop_county[,c(2:7)] <- apply(tn_pop_county[,c(2:7)], 2, function(x) as.numeric(x))
TN$Pop <- tn_pop_county[7]

save(TN, file = 'sourceData.RDat')
```
